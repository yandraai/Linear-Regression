Linear Regression 
===================

- Data set Used: White Wines (Please look in DATA folder -- winequality-white.csv)

Question 1
------------

- Do linear regression to learn the single-feature regression models, one model for each of the 11 features. Find the R2 and AIC values for each of these models. 
  Select the model with the highest R2 value, combine with its feature other features, one at a time, and thus generate all bivariate regression models (models containing two features). 
  Repeat the steps above to generate (k+1)-feature models from the k-feature models until the following situation arises: all the (k+1)-feature models have an AIC value higher than the AIC value of the k-feature model from which they are being generated. Stop the process and report the k-feature model found as being the best regression model for this data. 
  Report the features included, their coefficients, and p-values for the coefficients. Comment on the magnitudes of the p-values.
